# Intro

This module is a hand-written translation from the 9p implementation at code.google.com/p/goplan9 to javascript.

# Dependencies

All required files are stored in the project itself, so you don't have to download anything after cloning the repo.

The dependencies used are:

sprintf -> string formatting (https://github.com/alexei/sprintf.js)
qunit -> testing
